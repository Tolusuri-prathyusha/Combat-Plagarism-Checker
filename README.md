## Plagiarism Checker
# Introduction
The plagiarism checker project aims to develop a tool capable of detecting similarities between documents to identify potential instances of plagiarism. Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work or ideas without proper attribution, which can be a serious academic or ethical issue.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the plagiarism checker consists of pairs of documents, where one document is considered the source and the other is the suspicious document. Each pair is labeled with a similarity score indicating the degree of similarity between the documents.

# Model Architecture
Various techniques can be used for plagiarism detection, including:

* Bag-of-Words (BoW): This method represents documents as bags of their constituent words, disregarding grammar and word order. Similarity between documents is computed based on the overlap of words in their respective bags.

* TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): TF-IDF calculates the importance of each word in a document relative to its occurrence in the entire corpus. Similarity between documents can be computed using cosine similarity or other distance metrics.

* Word Embeddings: Techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText provide dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space. Similarity between documents can be computed based on the similarity of their word embeddings.

* Siamese Neural Networks: Siamese networks are neural network architectures designed for comparing pairs of inputs. They can be used to learn a similarity function directly from data, allowing for more complex patterns to be captured.

* The choice of model architecture depends on factors such as the size and complexity of the dataset, available computational resources, and desired performance.

# Training
The plagiarism detection model is trained using the labeled dataset. The training process involves feeding pairs of documents into the model and adjusting its parameters to minimize a predefined loss function, such as binary cross-entropy or mean squared error.

# Evaluation
The performance of the plagiarism detection model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model detects instances of plagiarism compared to the ground truth.

# Usage
To use the plagiarism checker:

Install the necessary dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Prepare pairs of documents for plagiarism detection.
Load the trained model weights.
Feed pairs of documents into the model for similarity detection.
Analyze the similarity scores to identify potential instances of plagiarism.
# Results
The performance of the plagiarism detection model is assessed on a separate test dataset. The evaluation metrics demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately detecting similarities between documents and identifying potential instances of plagiarism.

# Future Improvements
Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to improve performance.
Incorporate domain-specific features or knowledge to enhance the model's ability to detect plagiarism in specific contexts.
Explore ensemble learning techniques to combine predictions from multiple models for enhanced accuracy and robustness.
